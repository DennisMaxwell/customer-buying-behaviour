# Customer Buying Behavior Prediction

A machine learning project to predict customer buying behavior using transactional, demographic, and behavioral data. This repository covers data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation to build accurate predictive models. It leverages classification, regression, and clustering techniques to analyze purchasing patterns and support better business decisions.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing for structured datasets  
- Feature engineering with RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis  
- Predictive modeling using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting  
- Customer segmentation via K-Means clustering  
- Model evaluation using classification and regression metrics  
- Visualization of customer insights and model performance  

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For exploratory data analysis and modeling  
- **Machine Learning Models**: Classification, regression, and clustering techniques  

## Dataset

The dataset is provided in CSV format and contains customer transactional, demographic, and behavioral data. *(Include details about the dataset source if it's public, or mention if it's synthetic or confidential.)*

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DennisMaxwell/customer-buying-behavior-prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd customer-buying-behavior-prediction
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Place your CSV dataset in the `data/` folder and update paths in the notebooks as needed.

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebooks:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Run the notebooks to explore data, train models, and evaluate predictions.
